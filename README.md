# Purpose: 
- use heart disease dataset to train different MLlib classification regression models.
- use trained model to identify which cases are identified as critical.
		 
# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objetive:
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to different MLlib classification models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
- compare the performance among different MLlib classification models.
